# Live Execution Development Prompt

> **Use this prompt to start development. Always reference the SSOT documents for specific details.**

## Start Here

1. **Read the SSOT Documents**:
   - `docs/live/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture design and component specifications
   - `docs/live/ROADMAP.md` - Complete implementation roadmap (all phases, decisions, guidelines)
   - `docs/live/FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` - File structure and organization strategy
   - `docs/live/README.md` - Documentation overview

2. **Use Context7**:
   - Always use Context7 to get latest NautilusTrader documentation
   - Use Context7 for any external library documentation needed
   - Verify implementation patterns against Context7 best practices

3. **Follow the Documents**:
   - Documents are SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
   - Update documents as you implement (keep them coherent)
   - When in doubt, check the documents first

## Development Workflow

1. **Check Current Phase**: See `ROADMAP.md` for current implementation phase
2. **Review Requirements**: Check `ROADMAP.md` for phase-specific requirements
3. **Follow File Structure**: Use `FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` for directory organization
4. **Implement**: Follow patterns from existing backtest system where applicable
5. **Update Documents**: Keep documents updated as implementation progresses
6. **Verify**: Ensure alignment with SSOT documents

## Key Principles

- **Documents are SSOT**: Always refer to documents for specific details
- **Keep Documents Updated**: Update documents as you implement
- **Use Context7**: Always use Context7 for external documentation
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with backtest system where applicable
- **Modularity**: Follow existing modular design patterns

**Remember**: This prompt is a guide. All specific details, requirements, and decisions are in the SSOT documents (`ROADMAP.md`, `FILE_ORGANIZATION.md`).
