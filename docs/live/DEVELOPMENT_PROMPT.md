# Live Execution Development Prompt

Develop live execution per `docs/live/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/live/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, `docs/live/SUMMARY.md`. Use TradingNode for Binance/Bybit/OKX, external adapters for Deribit/IB. Implement Execution Orchestrator, Unified OMS, Position Tracker, Risk Engine, Smart Router. Use UCS for GCS. Follow phases: infrastructure → TradingNode → adapters → OMS/tracking → risk/router → testing.
